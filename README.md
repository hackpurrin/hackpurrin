I'm just an ordinary gamer who wants to learn Java, and I.T skills. I am already really skilled with the computer, but wish to learn more and more! I know some Python, and can code in HTML and CSS. Not very skilled in JavaScript lol. I usually play Minecraft and Half-Life but I am explorative and open with my games..
Woohoo! In class, I passed the Small Basic unit with flying colors! Now, into whatever lang is next!
