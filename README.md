### Describe yourself

This website was made by a nerdy person who was just bored. I'm just an ordinary gamer. Loves cats, and older stuff. I love to repurpose old tech and try to make it usable today. I usally play Minecraft and Half-Life, but I am very explorative with my games.

### Jobs?

I'm only a teenager, so I don't have a job. I wan't to go into cybersecurity tho! Let's hack the world!

### Do I smell gamer?

I'm a very clean person, so shut up.

I usually play Minecraft and Half-Life but I am explorative and open with my games.
